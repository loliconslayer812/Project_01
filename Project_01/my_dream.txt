Mom and dad always said that I could be anything you want when I become an adult. Therefore, I said to them that I want to be
a racecar. However, they said that it was impossible. Weird, I remember they told me I could be ANYTHING. Thus, I change my
mind and I want to be a pumpkin. However I became an excellent student and ended up at Elephant major of Miaim University. 
The classes are very fun and nutty.
