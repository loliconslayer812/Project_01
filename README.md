Implement a string parser program using Java, along with specified methods, that can read words from a text file, parse those word, and write those word to a new file. There are 3 options for output file: 
 - Raw output: print everything, each word is written in a separate line
 - Palindromes: write only palindromes in alphabetical order, one line at time, without repetition
 - $100 words: Writing only $100 words to output file. $100 words are found by assigning $1 to A, $2 to B, and so on. For example
   ELEPHANTS is a $100 word because: E + L + E + P + H + A + N + T + S is 5 + 12 + 5 + 16 + 8
   + 1 + 14 + 20 + 19 = 100.
